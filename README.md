## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Code Overview

The backend handles authentication, scheduling, gamification, and email notifications.

### Key Components

#### Email Notifications

```python
msg = Message(
    subject="Appointment Confirmation",
    recipients=[user_email],
    html=email_body
)
mail.send(msg)
```

#### Gamification Badges and Medals

```python
cursor.execute('''
    UPDATE badges
    SET badges = badges + 1, 
        medals = badges // 10
    WHERE user_id = ?
''', (user_id,))
```

#### QR Code Generation for Vouchers

```python
qr_data = f"User ID: {user_id}, Donations: {donations}, Voucher ID: {user_id}-voucher"
qr = qrcode.make(qr_data)
```
#### Snake Game Badge Awarding

The `/win_game` endpoint handles the logic for awarding a badge when the user wins the snake game:

```python
@app.route('/win_game', methods=['POST'])
def win_game():
    user_id = session['user_id']
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    cursor.execute('''
        UPDATE badges
        SET badges = badges + 1
        WHERE user_id = ?
    ''', (user_id,))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    return jsonify({"message": "Badge awarded!"}), 200
```
